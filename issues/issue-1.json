Everybody gets to post their own comment, and edit it at any time.\r\n- Static - after we're done with the meeting, there's no chance the notes will accidentally be deleted\r\n- Public and transparent - other teams and contributors may want to know what we're up to. A Google doc isn't the most accessible resource.",
