## Valentin

- landed bug 1521808 (Cross Origin Opener Policy)

- looked into whether TRR ECS pref works correctly
- 1520062 - HTTPChannel seems to incorrectly keep references to its mListener.
  - patch that fixes leak

- Socket process
   1) Bug 1527256 - [socket process] make about:networking work
   2) Merge mc to larch
- Bug 1521729 - Make nsHttpChannel::AsyncOpen wait (async) for HSTS data to be available before connecting to non-https URLs

## Junior

- land sec bug 1507110 
- uplift  Bug 1505844 Crash in mozilla::dom::FetchDriver::HttpFetch to esr 60.5.2 since reuters used `fetch data://`

## Valentin

  Christian Holler (:decoder):
  - better necko fuzzing
  - no systematic approach for doing necko fuzzing from outside of the browser
  - create generic fuzzing layer to provide networking data in a buffer
  - prototyped by kershaw
  - integrated with libfuzzer - observes code coverage while testing.
  - gtest is fuzzing target
  - websocket as fuzzing target (a little more complicated) - doubles code coverage compared with our current tests
  - async is a problem for libfuzzer but that is mostly fixed
  - non-determinism in the fuzzer - some use cases aren't always reproducible
  - DNS should be disabled (network.dns.native-is-localhost can be used?)
  - needs another ENV variable to enable/disable?
  - not landing fuzzing target until most bugs are found
  - Honza to help with non-determinism
  - Fuzzing TLS is difficult
  - We could disable TLS for HTTP2
  - compression is already fuzzed - so we may want to disable compression
     - identity compression for websocket?
  - buildflags for libfuzzer. WS keychecking is disabled
  - goal is to cover all files in http/ folder
  - http2 is also undertested
  - TLS is another layer, like the fuzzer, we can fake it. maybe needs necko help
  - it scales
  - is run like a gtest
  - is very fast because is does no networking
