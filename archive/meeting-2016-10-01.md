Round Table:

Nick

 - the continuing saga of the predictor leak - cache race of some sort? (honza - thank you!)
 - telemetry & prefability of hpack table size (is it my bug in firefox? is it my bug in node-http2? is it both? WHO KNOWS?!)
 - errors loading recaptcha styles on super-slow connections (may not be our problem)

Honza

 - cache:
* write backlog
* frecency - is it the right way?
* shutdown crashes
* windows specific code (memmap)
* net/cache racing (more aggressive)
 - windows IO hangs bug
 - new poll code, what to do with it?
