# Meeting 2018-12-13
### Announcements:
- **You can now use https://mozilla-necko.github.io/necko-triage/ for triage**
- Triage:
  - This week: Dragana (Dec 10 - Dec 14)
  - Next week: Selena / Junior (Dec 17 - Dec 21)

### Roundtable: Reasons to keep our meeting notes in GitHub
- Searchable - just as much as a Google doc, but it is way easier to parse (either by looking at it, or with the GH API).
- Structured - it's easy to see what happened and when. Everybody gets to post their own comment, and edit it at any time.
- Static - after we're done with the meeting, there's no chance the notes will accidentally be deleted
- Public and transparent - other teams and contributors may want to know what we're up to. A Google doc isn't the most accessible resource.
