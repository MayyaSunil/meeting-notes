Meeting 2024-01-30
==================

*   Valentin: Following discussions in the previous meetings we decided we want to start publishing public meeting notes again, to increase visibility of the teamâ€™s achievements.
    
    *   The teamâ€™s meeting document will include a _Public section_. Add all of your updates there.
        
    *   After the meeting one team member will upload this section to [https://github.com/mozilla-necko/meeting-notes/](https://github.com/mozilla-necko/meeting-notes/)Â 
        
    *   Iâ€™ve built a [simple web-extension to upload clipboard contents to github](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clip-to-github/).
        
        *   Copy the contents of this section to the clipboard
            
        *   Click webextension to upload to github
            
        *   (optional) Update file title and contents.
            
        *   **DEMO**

    *   We sometimes land fixed/features preffed-off and forget to turn them back on
        
    *   We should start tracking these prefs and make sure to enable them as soon as possible to avoid issues. Iâ€™ve created [a confluence page to define a process for tracking such prefs.](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FIREFOX/pages/546308147/Tracking+disabled+Necko+features)
        
    *   Could use timer additionally: [Reminder Functionality in Bugzilla (via Autonag Bot)](https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-platform/c/QznyG9gzwYc/m/aGS52shgAAAJ), Example usage: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=1841061](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1841061)
