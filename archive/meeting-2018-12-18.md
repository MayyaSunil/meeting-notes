## Valentin

**Worked on:**
- [ ] Bug 1513574 - Remove UserAgentOverrides.jsm
  Turns out it's barely used, and not worth rewriting in C++ (happily I found that out before doing a complete rewrite :smile:  )
  Changed some of the android browser.js to use nsIDocShell.customUserAgent instead of UAOverride for desktopMode. And I debugged the tests with the x86 emulator, and android artifact builds.
- [ ] Bug 1510691 - [socket process] Send data directly from the socket process to a content process.

**PTO 19 Dec -  7 Jan**
**Merry Christmas to everyone :christmas_tree: :santa:**
