    -   Slides available at [https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-1873-debugging-http-3-upload-speed-in-firefox/](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-1873-debugging-http-3-upload-speed-in-firefox/)
    

-   We’ve had to backout [1603699 - Enable DefaultURI use for unknown schemes](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1603699) due to breaking some protocol handlers.
    

    -   Some older websites use a protocol format that don’t conform to the URL standard (example: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed2k\_URI\_scheme#File\_link\_format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed2k_URI_scheme#File_link_format) )
    
    -   We will try to enable this feature again, but add an allow list for known schemes that are broken.
