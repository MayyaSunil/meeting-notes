# Meeting 2019-01-17
### Triage: https://mozilla-necko.github.io/necko-triage/
  - This week: **Dragana**

### Round table items:
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1520125 - proxy issue; can anyone else take this?
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1467223 - fission blocker, honza
  - telemetry question: 30% of probes are by default on in release, but the telemetry dashboard isn't obvious how to get this. there's an analyze function and dragana will provide some guidance. ask in #fx-metrics for details
    - seems you need to be logged in to see the release metrics
