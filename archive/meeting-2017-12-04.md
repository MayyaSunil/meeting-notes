NECKO WEEKLY MEETING NOTES

Thurs November 29th, 2017

-----------------------------------------------
TRIAGE
- Note: use these 2 queries when you're on triage duty: all bugs should be [necko-triaged] and have a priority
  - UNTRIAGED bugs: https://mzl.la/2wAv7XZ
  - MALFORMED bugs (have necko-triaged but no priority): https://mzl.la/2xXf2jc

- P1 bugs  https://mzl.la/2he1C85
- P2 bugs  https://mzl.la/2yaD1aO
- P3 bugs  (backlog) https://mzl.la/2xcYzEL
- P5 bugs (would take): https://mzl.la/2hdnQXy

- Triage Notes
    - Android crashes on infra are currently not symbolicated: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1389805 (makes triaging/diagnosing android crash bugs hard/impossible)

SC
[Socket Process]
- evaluating impact on PSM/NSS with @dkeeler
 - PSM/NSS access a lot of chrome-process-only data
 - preference, data file in profile folder, system file in /dev and /etc, load 3rd-party DLL
- update requirements in https://wiki.mozilla.org/Necko:_Sandboxing_TCP/UDP_socket_in_a_separate_process#Requirements
 - thinking about moving cache to socket process as well for simplicity
- Prototyping
 - implementing UDPSocket with Endpoint utility, ongoing
[Others]
- Bug 1417901 - Firefox is changing 301 HTTP redirects to HTTPS when done on an HTTPS server
 - for top-level navigation, we need to disable Upgrade-Insecure-Request if redirect to non-secure cross-origin URL
 - f+ for WIP
- security bug
 - provide second WIP, f-'ed by @mayhemer
 - need to find some other solution that not play with refcount
