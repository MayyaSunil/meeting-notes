  - MALFORMED bugs (have necko-triaged but no priority): https://mzl.la/2xXf2jc

Gary

Bug 1415115 - PERMA-FAIL | accessible/tests/mochitest/events/docload/test_docload_root.html | Test timed out.

Junior

Bug 1415120 - Crash in mozilla::detail::RunnableFunction<nsCookieService::RebuildCorruptDB(DBState*)::<lambda()>::<lambda()> >::Run

- r?
- Root cause: cookie requests during rebuilding and we close the all the connections. The request is trying to connect a db which is renamed and not loaded.
- solution: access the cookies from hashtable. drop all the db operations because we will backport them to new db anyway.
Bug 1413839 - Add telemetry to probe how close we’re going to block main thread

- r?
Bug 1416985 - MOZ_SQLITE_COOKIES_OLD_SCHEMA seems bogus for unreasonable many people using cookies.txt

- WIP

Amy

Bug 1357676 - Increase cookie count limits to match Chrome’s

*- Basic setup for new process, such as new process type, init XPCOM, etc.
*- TODO:
*  Try to create UDPSocket in socket process
*  sandboxing

SC

[Socket Process]

 - study "Endpoint" mechanism for IPC between child process (reference: bug wwwwww)
 - Prototyping
  - design interface and flow for UDPSocket
  - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12Jg2eXT7nne2G8MtS3E2p7yRGaQJrvXg8iiQOhYggFU/edit#slide=id.g286761667d_0_0
 - create project wiki page https://wiki.mozilla.org/Necko:_Sandboxing_TCP/UDP_socket_in_a_separate_process
 - discuss sandboxing design with @pauljt
  - put protocol code in separate process is better
  - try not have plain TCP/UDP IPC interface, to have better control on the network usage
[Others]

 - Bug 1390708 - .hqx files are all corrupted when downloaded with FF unless going through SAVE AS...
  - remove BinHex stream converter support, landed on m-c (firefox 59)
- Bug 1416879 - Crash in mozilla::net::HttpChannelParentListener::OnDataAvailable
 - parent ODA called during channel suspension for diversion, might be timing issue caused by intercept stream listener
