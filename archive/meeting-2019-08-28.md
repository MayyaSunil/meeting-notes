QUIC

* Told Cloudflare we cannot commit to Sep 23 date for joint announcement on QUIC support. Still too many unknowns and missing pieces.
* Continuing work on fixing bugs, reviewing PRs, and implementing missing critical features for initial inclusion in mozilla-central.

DoH rollout

* Preparing for North America DoH rollout with plugin
  * Working on SUMO doc around heuristics
  * Use of global canary domain: what we're going to do should be considered an interim solution until something better gets standardized, but it's really important that we have some solution at launch
  * Expect functionality in plugin will need to eventually transition to the platform, including heuristics. We should expect heuristics and logic around DoH operation will be needed for medium- if not long-term.
