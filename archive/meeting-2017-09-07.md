NECKO WEEKLY MEETING NOTES

Thurs Sept 7th, 2017
STICKY
- Triage duty: nwgh
-  new untriaged bugs: https://tinyurl.com/zhk9yjf
- NECKO-ACTIVE bugs: https://tinyurl.com/j8pj35u
- NECKO NEXT bugs: https://tinyurl.com/zjwjfee
- NECKO-BACKLOG bugs:  https://tinyurl.com/hpkcxx3
- Triage Notes
    - Android crashes on infra are currently not symbolicated: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1389805 (makes triaging/diagnosing android crash bugs hard/impossible)

Round Table:
*57 Nightly, Beta milestones   https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jeypuqBqEyIh-4qxXT0UnE2aVjetN7uVD8W7L7TbWKg/edit
*Bug 1397635 needs review and blocks a qf1. would be really nice to have it for 57. Thanks!
*Bug 910207 - Speculative connections should prevent Client Certificate Selection dialog
*Can someone help to land this bug? A mandatory photon feature(bug 1348275) depends on this to be in Firefox 57, and better to uplift to 56 as well.
*Bug 1393540 rel=preload and our speculative load queue


*(15:48:00) annevk: if y'all have meetings, could you bring up fixing https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1363284 as part of some Quantum effort
*(15:48:28) annevk: we even have Google devrel volunteering to draw up graphics how it makes Firefox faster than Chrome
*(15:49:05) annevk: https://twitter.com/annevk/status/901493567855710208

SC
[PBg-Http]
 - performance analysis
  - First Paint time for visible elements in HTML document is improved because HTML parser will start to create DOM element earlier.
    The difference can be observed from TALOS tp6 amazon/youtube. The average first paint time is improved around 50ms.
  - However for facebook no improvement is observed because there is no visible element in the HTML document.
    In the HTML document there is only for loading CSS/JS scripts and executing <script> element. All the visible DOM elements are added after running a bunch of JS code.
    In this case, the bottle neck of rendering is still on main thread. PBg-Http is only changing order of some tasks but cannot gain any performance improvement.
  - I tried to dispatch StopRequestEvent runnables into high priority queue. The TALOS result shows changes dramatically.
    Performance test is either improved a lot or regress a lot. All the tp6 test cases are seeing huge improves (around 80~100ms for amazon/youtube/facebook, 30ms for google).
    However, the tpaint, tp5o_scroll, and several tp5o metrics are regressed a lot.
    My impression is this patch changes the event sequence too much, so that the performance landscape is changed too much.
    TALOS result: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/perf.html#/compare?originalProject=try&originalRevision=fd6dceb87671ff98461f935a0be00678f017264b&newProject=try&newRevision=e5cfac6814cfe32fa7ad6a8bf084bb874d4d7fd7&framework=1&showOnlyImportant=0&showOnlyConfident=1
  - I did scrolling smoothness test on facebook timeline page with Taipei Hasal team.
    No obvious performance change after PBg-Http is enabled because the jank is caused by JS code in web page and rendering.
    This is because facebook uses React framework, which is using javascript to manage components and virtual DOM tree.
  - QA in taipei also help record a comparison video of scrolling smoothness on instagram.
    With PBg-Http enabled the scrolling speed and smoothness is improved [comparison video https://youtu.be/rlWsig8YA58].
    Looked into the corresponding gecko profile, instagram is use less heavy JS to do the incremental loading. Thus, the benefit of OMT is easier to be observed.
 - trying to get CC/GC log from treeherder for investigating bug 1353829
  - major difference is because different set of decoded image is hold by Gecko. This is highly related to the change of loading sequence.
