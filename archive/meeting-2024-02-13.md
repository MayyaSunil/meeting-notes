-   \[valentin\] jschanck: Hi all, I plan to enable the X25519+Kyber768 key agreement mechanism for TLS 1.3 over TCP on the desktop Nightly channel on Monday. This is the first step in our migration to post-quantum cryptography, and I think it's (very!) important. However, we may see some negative performance impact on the tails due to Kyber's large public keys (1184 bytes sent by the client) and ciphertexts (1088 bytes sent by the server). Please reach out if you hear any reports of breakage or performance issues. The mechanism can be disabled by setting security.tls.enable\_kyber to false.

-   \[valentin\] [Bug 1824218 - Captive portal login tab does not get closed automatically](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1824218)
    

    -   I happened to look through this report (even though I don’t have a lot of experience with the UI parts of captive-portal). I think this patch should reduce the number of reports from users who’s windows don’t close because of the race.
