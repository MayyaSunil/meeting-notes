NECKO WEEKLY MEETING NOTES

Thurs March 10, 2016

Round Table:
 Facebook 
- JS parsing is taking a lot of time
- Spending 400ms parsing JS (not even JITing).
- Typically see a 10:1 parse:execute time ratio
- Would prefer to get bytecode from HTTP cache, like Safari already does.
- Using asm.js/webassembly is not a fix for them at this point.
- each version of script has its own URI and is given a 1 year expiration
  - as a result, 70% of the time their JS is already in the HTTP cache.
- CSS parsing is also expensive (some talk about caching binary format)
- Also interested in storing parsed HTML


Nick
