Bug 1013635 - http-on-response-set-cookie notification should be sync
  I have modified dispatch to sync, but I found it still caused the error as below:
  StorageUI.prototype.onUpdate@resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://devtools/client/storage/ui.js:348
Bug 1293067 - (feature request): Implement a cookie limit warning
  I have added a notify function when cookie size too big on nsCookieService.cpp, and I will create a warning message on web console.
