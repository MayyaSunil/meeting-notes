Valentin

1151899 - integrate rust-url into necko

        - added new RustURL class which wrapps rust-url-capi
        - ability to unit test individually
        - nsStandardURL (may) has a reference to a RustURL object and forwards calls to it/compares the result
1310483 - [reviewing] adds query to nsSimpleURI

        - did a little refactoring
        - found several inconsistencies (bugs) in setter code
        - (small thought - it may be easier to replace this with RustURL than nsStandardURL - will investigate)
945240 - Consider making Location.href punycode non-ASCII hostnames

        - blocked on updating firefox UI code
        - prerequisite to using RustURL
